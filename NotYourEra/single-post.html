                    <p><span>Before Contract Signing : </span>Before Nirvana signed with Geffen Records, they were an independent band that had released their debut album, "Bleach," through Sub Pop Records in 1989. The album received positive attention in the alternative music community, but it did not achieve great popularity.</p>
                    <p><span>First Meeting : </span>In the early 1990s, Nirvana began to attract the attention of major record labels, including Geffen Records, thanks to their early success and successful European tours. </p>
                    <p><span>contract negotiation : </span>The meeting between Nirvana and Geffen Records resulted in contract negotiations that lasted several months. Nirvana, who had always maintained creative independence and control, wanted to ensure that they would have control over their music, especially in the upcoming album. They also sought to maintain their artistic freedom. <b><em>The contract that was finally agreed upon was a fairly favorable deal for Nirvana.</b></em></p>
                    <p><span>Contract Signing Impact : </span>This major record label gave them financial resources, strong distribution, and a global platform for their music. "Nevermind" became one of the best-selling albums in rock history, and Nirvana became the most recognized band in the grunge genre.</p>

                    <p><span>Peak Personal Hardship : </span>Prior to this tragic event, Kurt Cobain had experienced a number of deep personal difficulties. Cobain was known for his struggles with mental health and addiction to illegal drugs, particularly heroin. These issues got worse during the last years of his life, and he entered rehab several times to try and overcome his addiction.</p>
                    <p><span>Last Journey : </span>In March 1994, Cobain disappeared from a rehabilitation center in California. He went to Seattle, his hometown, where he lived with his wife, Courtney Love, and their daughter, Frances Bean Cobain. Over the next few weeks, there was confusion about Cobain's whereabouts, and he was believed to be in a very vulnerable state.</p>
                    <p><span>Search and Findings : </span>On April 8, 1994, a home technician who came to Kurt Cobain's Seattle home found Cobain dead in an upstairs room in the house. He was found with a shotgun beside him and drug injection marks on his hands. Police soon confirmed that Cobain was dead.</p>

Fans gathered outside Cobain's home and television stations reported on the event constantly. The tragedy also sparked conversations about mental health issues, addiction and the pressures faced by famous musicians.</p>
                    <p><span>Legacy and Talks : </span>A few months after his death, the compilation album "MTV Unplugged in New York" was released, which became Nirvana's last legacy and recorded the band's legendary acoustic performances.

                    <pre>"To Boddah,

                  Speaking from the tongue of an experienced simpleton who obviously would rather be an emasculated, infantile complain-ee. This note should be pretty easy to understand.
                         
                  All the warnings from the punk rock 101 courses over the years, since my first introduction to the, shall we say, ethics involved with independence and the embracement of your community has proven to be very true. I haven’t felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing for too many years now. I feel guilty beyond words about these things.
                         
                  For example, when we’re back stage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowds begins, it doesn’t affect me the way in which it did for Freddie Mercury, who seemed to love, relish in the love and adoration from the crowd which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact is, I can’t fool you, any one of you. It simply isn’t fair to you or me. The worst crime I can think of would be to rip people off by faking it and pretending as if I’m having 100% fun. Sometimes I feel as if I should have a punch-in time clock before I walk out on stage. I’ve tried everything within my power to appreciate it (and I do, God, believe me, I do, but it’s not enough). I appreciate the fact that I and we have affected and entertained a lot of people. It must be one of those narcissists who only appreciate things when they’re gone. I’m too sensitive. I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasms I once had as a child.
                         
                  On our last 3 tours, I’ve had a much better appreciation for all the people I’ve known personally, and as fans of our music, but I still can’t get over the frustration, the guilt and empathy I have for everyone. There’s good in all of us and I think I simply love people too much, so much that it makes me feel too fucking sad. The sad little, sensitive, unappreciative, Pisces, Jesus man. Why don’t you just enjoy it? I don’t know!
                         
                  I have a goddess of a wife who sweats ambition and empathy and a daughter who reminds me too much of what I used to be, full of love and joy, kissing every person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm. And that terrifies me to the point to where I can barely function. I can’t stand the thought of Frances becoming the miserable, self-destructive, death rocker that I’ve become.
                         
                  I have it good, very good, and I’m grateful, but since the age of seven, I’ve become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along that have empathy. Only because I love and feel sorry for people too much I guess.
                         
                  Thank you all from the pit of my burning, nauseous stomach for your letters and concern during the past years. I’m too much of an erratic, moody baby! I don’t have the passion anymore, and so remember, it’s better to burn out than to fade away.
                         
Peace, love, empathy.
Kurt Cobain
                         
Frances and Courtney, I’ll be at your alter.
Please keep going Courtney, for Frances.
For her life, which will be so much happier without me.
I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU!"
